# Why i use Python
I'm starting using Python back in 2016, I'm start learning it becures i start building microservices architecture in PHP and over time i relise PHP its not the most optimal developering languages to wirte microservices in and i hit some limit by using Curl orther annoying things.

Then after 2 years i think in 2018 i start learning Pandas and Numpy in a case where i shoud calcualte around 2,500,000 e-commerce products on rules based on brand, category, supplier, supplier country and more, after researching what options i got i get pointed into the Data Sinces world whitout knowing anything about Data Sinces.

I'm start with Python 2.7 and trust me when you are hit Python 3.6+ now, then you shoud not wish to go back for Python 2.7 if you lovle utf-8, encoding and special characters, but if you want challanges with this type of encoding then go back and transport data between differnet systems, platforms and software to hit this issue.
